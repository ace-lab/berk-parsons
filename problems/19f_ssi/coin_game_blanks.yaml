  <h4>Problem</h4>
  Alice and Bob are playing a game with coins on a table in a single row. In this game,
  they take turns removing 1-3 coins from the row.
  Whoever takes the last coin on the table wins the game. For example, if there are 2 coins
  on the table and Alice starts, Alice could take both coins to win. However,
  if Alice took only one coin, Bob would take the remaing one coin and win.<br><br>

  Implement <code>coin_winner(num_coins, current_player, other_player)</code>, which takes in the number of coins
  as an integer and the starting player and other player as strings, and returns who would win
  <b>if both players played optimally</b>. For example, if there were 2 coins on the table, the starting player
  would take all 2; if they took just one, they would lose when their opponent took the other one.

  <br><br>
  <pre><code>
  >>> coin_winner(1, 'Alice', 'Bob')  # Alice takes 1 coin
  'Alice'
  >>> coin_winner(3, 'Alice', 'Bob')  # Alice takes 3 coins
  'Alice'
  >>> coin_winner(3, 'Bob', 'Alice')  # Bob takes 3 coins
  'Bob'
  </code></pre>

  <br><br>
  <i>Hint:</i> These types of problems can often be solved with a recursive
  solution. The key observation is as follows: If current_player can make <b>any move
  </b> such that they will always win from the resulting board, then they
  have a winning strategy for that board. In this game, one player always
  has a winning strategy from any board, but not all moves necessarily
  lead to that winning strategy.<br>
  <i>Hint:</i> <code>coin_winner</code> should always returns a string.<br>
