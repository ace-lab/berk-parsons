problem_description: |
  In this demo, complete a function that returns 3.

initial_code: |
  def return_three():
  	# You can insert tabbed lines as well (necessary to Python)
    x = 2
    print('The code is running! x =', x)
    return x
code_lines: |
  def return_three():#0given
  # You can insert tabbed lines as well (necessary to Python)#1given
  x = 2
  x = x + 1
  return x

solution: |
  def return_three():
    x = 2
    x = x + 1
    return x
