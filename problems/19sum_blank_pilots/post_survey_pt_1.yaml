        The following questions will ask you separately about the specific <b>problems</b> you encountered
        in this study (Fizz Buzz, The Coin Game, and Odd Plusses) as well as the <b>exercise interfaces</b>
        you used (Code Writing, Code Arrangement, and Code Arrangement With Blanks).

        Imagine, before this study, you were given The Coin Game and Odd Plusses as homework questions,
        and asked to write code for both to solve them. How would you rate their
        difficulty relative to each other?<br>
      choices:
        - I would need more assistance to solve The Coin Game than Odd Plusses
        - I would need similar assistance, but it would take me longer to solve The Coin Game than Odd Plusses
        - It would take me a similar amount of time and assistance to solve both
        - I would need similar assistance, but it would take me longer to solve Odd Plusses than The Coin Game
        - I would need more assistance to solve Odd Plusses than The Coin Game

        Imagine you were given a game-winning tree recursion problem of similar difficulty to The Coin Game. Compared to
        how difficult it would have been to solve before the study, how difficult would it be to solve now?<br>
      choices:
        - It would have taken me a similar amount of time and assistance to solve before the study as it would now
        - It would have taken me longer to solve before the study, but I would have needed similar assistance.
        - I would have needed more assistance to solve it before the study than I would need now.

        Imagine you were given a conditional tree recursion problem very similar to Odd Plusses. Compared to
        how difficult it would have been to solve before the study, how difficult would it be to solve now?<br>
      choices:
        - It would have taken me a similar amount of time and assistance to solve before the study as it would now
        - It would have taken me longer to solve before the study, but I would have needed similar assistance.
        - I would have needed more assistance to solve it before the study than I would need now.

        How has your ability to solve these two types of problems improved relative to each other?<br>
      choices:
        - I have improved more on problems of similar type and difficulty to The Coin Game
        - I have improved similarly for both types of problems
        - I have improved more on problems of similar type and difficulty to Odd Plusses

        Think about a Code Writing question on a recent homework. Briefly describe the problem
        below.

        Now imagine you were instead asked to solve that question with one of the Code Arragement
        interfaces used in this study. For each interface, how would you rank the
        difficulty of solving the problem relative to Code Writing?

      choices:
      - I would need less assistance to solve a Code Arrangment problem (Code Arrangement is much easier)
      - I would need less time to solve a Code Arrangement problem, but I would need similar assistance
      - I would need a similar amount of time to solve a Code Arrangement problem
      - I would need more time to solve a Code Arrangement problem, but I would need similar assistance
      - I would need more assistance to solve a Code Arrangement problem (Code Arrangement is much harder)

        Thinking back to that same Code Writing HW question: Imagine that question could be left
        as is, changed to one of the Code Arrangement interfaces, or you could instead add 2nd
        similar question (in any combination of the exercise interfaces). To best
        prepare yourself to answer a similar question on an exam later in the class, would you
        want 1 or 2 questions on the topic and with which exercise interfaces? Please briefly
        explain why this choice is better than the others.
