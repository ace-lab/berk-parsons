  <h4>Problem</h4>
  Alice and Bob are playing a game with coins on a table in 2 distinct rows. In this game,
  they take turns removing any non-zero number of coins from one of the rows.
  Whoever takes the last coin on the table wins the game. For example, if there are 2 coins
  on the table in a single row and Alice starts, Alice could take both coins to win. However,
  if the 2 coins were in 2 different rows, Alice would have to take one of them, then Bob would
  take the remaining coin to win the game.<br><br>

  Implement <code>coin_winner(row1, row2, current_player, other_player)</code>, which takes in the number of coins
  in each row as a list of integers and the starting player and other player as strings, and returns who would win
  <b>if both players played optimally</b>. For example, if there were 5 coins in a single row the table, the starting player
  would take all 5; if they took any less, they would lose as their opponent could take all the remaining coins.

  <br><br>
  <pre><code>
  >>> coin_winner(1, 0, 'Alice', 'Bob')  # Alice takes 1 coin
  'Alice'
  >>> coin_winner(0, 5, 'Alice', 'Bob')  # Alice takes 5 coins
  'Alice'
  >>> coin_winner(1, 1, 'Alice', 'Bob')  # Alice takes 1 coin from either row.
                                           # Bob takes the remaining 1 coin.
  'Bob'
  </code></pre>

  <i>Hint:</i> These types of problems can often be solved with a recursive
  solution. The key observation is as follows: If current_player can make <b>any move
  </b> such that they will always win from the resulting board, then they
  have a winning strategy for that board. In this game, one player always
  has a winning strategy from any board, but not all moves necessarily
  lead to that winning strategy.<br>
  <i>Hint:</i> <code>coin_winner</code> should always returns a string.<br>
  <i>Hint:</i> <code>li[:]</code> returns a copy of the list <code>li</code><br>
  <i>Hint:</i> <code>[x for x in li if x]</code> creates a copy of the list <code>li</code> with all <code>0</code>s removed.
