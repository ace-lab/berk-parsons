problem_name: tutorial

algorithm_description:
  Define an algorithm to find <b> a + |b| </b> where a and b are both integers. As a reminder, the absolute
  value of a number is the magnitude of the number, ignoring the sign.

  <br />
  <br />
  This algorithm should invert the sign of b if it is negative, then add together a and b.
