algorithm_description: |
  The general structure of this experiment is: <br />
  <b> Multiple Choice Comprehension Question -> Algorithm Implementation -> Algorithm Solution -> Coding Question </b>
  <br />
  <br />
  For each step, clicking the <b> submit code </b> button will test your code.
  <br />
  <br />

  For the tutorial, the algorithm you are defining is related to absolute value: define an algorithm to find a + |b|,
  where a and b are both integers. As a reminder, the absolute value of a number is the magnitude of the number, ignoring the sign.


problem_description:
  What would 3 + |-5| return?

      if b < 0
          Make B positive
      return a + b

choices:
  - -2
  - 2
  - 8
  - 0
